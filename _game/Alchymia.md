## Intro
It is a CSCI 526 class project and is also the first game I worked on. This is a single-player role playing game.
The background story of the game is that the player is an alchemist who starts a new life on an island town. The townsfolk are skeptical of the idea of an alchemist at first. The player has to prove their worth to them by utilizing their alchemy skills and helping the townsfolk with their various needs. When the game is played right, the townsfolk love/appreciate the player more and eventually accept them as a permanent town member.   

## Contribution
* Implemented the **AI path-finding system** to guide protagonist and NPC player to find their way.
* Developed the **time system** to record game timing and **light system** to adjust day/night environment change.
* Set up the **save** and **load system** for locally saving.
