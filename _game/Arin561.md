## Intro
Starting from January 2021, I joined the USC Institute of Creative Technology as a game programmer to work on this project. 
It is a 3D RPG game to help high shool students understand some basic concepts of AI, such as BFS, DFS and Greedy algorithm.
The background story is that our protagonist stuck in a mysterious planet "Arin-561". To repair his spaceship and leave the planet, the 
player needs to use his knowledge to fulfill different task based on AI concept.
