## Intro
From Januray - May 2021, I joined the Larger Than Light team to work as a game developer. It is a narrative 
puzzle game where players manipulate the light and shadow to cross the nightmare world. 

The player controls two characters, Skia and Lux, at the same time, both are trapped in a 
school-like environment. Lux has the ability to cast the light to manipulate the shadow, and Skia 
can move and jump on the platforms made out of shadow to explore the world. To escape the strange nightmare, 
They need to collaborate to go back to the reality.
